# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- PSR-11 dependency injection container (PHP-DI). Application services are
  now auto-wired; the legacy ConnectionPool / LoggerFactory statics remain
  for backwards compatibility but are wrapped behind container bindings.
- `phpstan/phpstan` (level 9) and `squizlabs/php_codesniffer` (PSR-12) added
  as require-dev so the documented "minimum bar" is actually enforceable.
  A `phpstan-baseline.neon` absorbs pre-existing errors so new code is held
  to the bar without forcing a repo-wide refactor.
- `docs/dev/architecture-server.md` and `docs/reference/env-vars.md`.

### Deprecated

- `Phlex\Server\Core\Application::getInstance()` — resolve services from
  the PSR-11 container instead. Slated for removal in Phase B.
